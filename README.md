# titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

- This is my attempt at a Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic where I submit a csv containing list of survivors given a test list.
- The titanic.py code is run from my Google colab notebook titanic.ipynb here https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hx7gT1fwjKl8R3EfxxHFFW_5YGPPxRZT?usp=sharing
- The train.csv and test.csv datasets were downloaded from Kaggle but I had to make changes to it for the code to work:
  - replacing spaces with "UNKNOWN" for Cabin column;
  - replacing spaces with "999" in columns Age and Fare;
  - replacing spaces with "X" in Embark column;
